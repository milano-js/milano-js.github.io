### Building Resilient Microservice APIs with REST and API Gateway (Vincenzo Chianese)


Building a microservices based architecture from an existing monolithic application is a non-trivial task with a lot of challenges. You will likely end up in with a completely different system in terms of architecture, components and more importantly the API surface you’re exposing; and that means breaking changes for your clients.
Is there a better way?

In this presentation we will deconstruct a sample monolithic application and refactor it into a set of microservices using a naive approach, taming all the problems that will rise one by one, and discover how a proper RESTful architecture combined with an API Gateway are invaluable tools for journey.

By the end of the presentation, we’ll fully make the switch from a monolithic application to microservices based version (and viceversa) without breaking the clients at all.

##### L'incontro si terrà presso il Talent Garden di via Merano
